# where do functions come from?
# 1. from python itself --> built-in
# 2. from modules 
# 3. written by myself

# name of the function should be significant

# functions take in arguments (as many as necessary to perform their tasks)
# python functions strongly demand the prescence of a pair of parentheses - opening and closing ones
# arguments are placed inside the parentheses
